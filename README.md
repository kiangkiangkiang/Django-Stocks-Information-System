# Django Stocks Information System - HTML crawl and chart.js implement

It is necessary that the project executes after a complete Django frame is built in the environment, including virtual environment files, etc.

With the Django frame completing, the following steps will build a web server for Taiwan stocks information system in your computer:

1. Open CMD, change direct to ithome_enve\scripts, and execute "activate", which is the way to go to the virtual environment.

2. Change direct to crawlStocks\ithome\scripts, where there exists files "manage.py".

3. Type "pyton manage.py reunserver" in CMD. (run the server on your computer)

4. Open the Chrome, go to your host (like 127.0.0.1), and add URL "/index", which is the home page of the web.

After doing so, the stocks information system will come into the view. The system is to collect Taiwan stocks, and using the chart to visualize.

Note : the crawl tools for chrome, which could be found at \ithmoe\chromedriver.exe, is the version 96. Users have to update the version whenever the chrome becomes the latest.
